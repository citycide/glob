> Match file paths against Unix style patterns called _globs_.

_glob_ is a cross-platform, pure Nim implementation of [globs][wiki] that supports
creating patterns, testing file paths, and walking through directories to find
matching files or directories.

You can find the full [documentation here](https://citycide.github.io/glob).

## installation & usage

Install using [Nimble][nimble]:

```shell
nimble install glob
```

Then `import` and use:

```nim
import glob

const pattern = glob("src/**/*.nim")
assert "src/foo.nim".matches(pattern)
assert "src/lib.rs".matches(pattern).not

# directories are expanded by default
# so `src` and `src/**` are equivalent
for path in walkGlob("src"):
  # every file in `src` or its subdirectories
  echo path
```

## development

To build `glob` from source you'll need to have [Nim][nim] installed,
and should also have [Nimble][nimble], Nim's package manager.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/citycide/glob.git`
2. Move into the newly cloned directory: `cd glob`
3. Make your changes: `src`, `tests.nim`
4. Run tests: `nimble test`

## contributing

This project is open to contributions of all kinds! Please check and search
the [issues](https://github.com/citycide/glob/issues) if you encounter a
problem before opening a new one. Pull requests for improvements are also
welcome &mdash; see the steps above for [development](#development).
